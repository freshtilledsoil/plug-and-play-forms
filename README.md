Plug and Play Forms
===================

A variety of forms that should be more or less plug and play. Styled with Bootstrap, using a modified version of jQuery Form Validation.

Technologies
------------

* Select [Bootstrap](https://github.com/twitter/bootstrap) styles are included, in a heavily modified form, to provide suitable defaults. Moving of styles from forms.scss to styles.scss so that everything is in one place is a work in progress.

* [Sass](http://sass-lang.com/) is included to make CSS development faster. Don't like Sass? Sorry, I do. But I do compile my Sass to stylesheets/application.css every time I commit, so you can work from that if you want to.

* [Bourbon](https://github.com/thoughtbot/bourbon) is included to make CSS3 use faster. This is used in place of Bootstrap's CSS3 mixins.

* [jQuery.validate.js](https://github.com/jzaefferer/jquery-validation) is currently included to quickly provide inline client-side form validation. Eventually, I plan to remove this in favor of lighter custom validation written for each form.

Pull requests are welcome, but as this project is young and much of it is still in flux, rejections may seem arbitrary. I will continue to solidify its purpose as fast as possible to make contribution guidelines clearer. Rest assured, I have a clear goal in mind and will do my best to continue to clarify it.
